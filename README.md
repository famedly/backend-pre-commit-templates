# Pre-commit templates

This holds precommit-hook definitions for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), that we can use in all our repositories.
Install pre-commit with `pip install pre-commit`

## Usage

Add the pre-commit configuration example (`.pre-commit-config-example.yaml`) as `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to your project and run `pre-commit install`. The pre-commit hooks are then run to checkyour commit for validity before.
